(1, 'Charlie Weston', 'Electric Ireland to cut prices for businesses but not households', 'The State’s largest electricity supplier has been called on to cut its prices for households after reducing energy costs for businesses.', '<p>The State’s largest electricity supplier has been called on to cut its prices for households after it emerged that it is reducing energy costs for businesses. Electric Ireland is reducing some prices by up to 15pc for firms, with an average cut of 10pc, from next month but said it had no immediate plans to introduce reductions for consumers. The Consumers Association said it was “galling and upsetting” for consumers to see price cuts for businesses but not for households. It said it was time that consumers saw a price reduction as wholesale energy costs have fallen back to 18-month lows.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>ESB-owned Electric Ireland has 1. 1 million electricity customers and 150,000 gas customers. Electric Ireland last increased prices in October, a move that saw electricity unit rates rising by 38pc and gas by 47pc. Those increases added around €446 a year to the average customer’s electricity bill and €516 to the gas bill.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>It increased prices for households three times last year and twice in 2021. This meant the average cost of electricity has doubled for the typical household to around €2,000 a year. Last week Pinergy became energy supplier to cut its prices in three years, a move that has ramped up pressure on bigger players like Electric Ireland and Bord Gáis Energy. Independent operator Pinergy broke ranks to deliver a price reduction of 7.1pc from the end of March.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Energy Minister Eamon Ryan has called on suppliers to households to cut prices now that wholesale costs are falling. Electric Ireland has confirmed businesses were going to see prices come down. It said there would be “an average 10pc decrease across Republic of Ireland SME Tariff customer base”.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Some small firms have been told they are getting larger reductions. Experts said some of the hikes for firms in the last year and a half have been more severe than those imposed on households. But chairman of the Consumers’ Association of Ireland Michael Kilcoyne said it was galling for consumers to see firms getting reductions while they are paying sky-high prices. “Instead of giving consumers €50 back, Electric Ireland should be cutting prices for ordinary consumers.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“This is galling and upsetting for people. Electric Ireland does not seem to care about ordinary people. ” He called on the State-owned company to review its pricing and said consumers were annoyed to learn recently that householders had been overcharged to subsidise larger corporate energy users. When asked why residential customers were not have their energy prices reduced, Electric Ireland said it offers the best value bill pay electricity prices in the residential market and strives to give customers a range of products at competitive prices.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“Price rises have been driven by wholesale gas costs, which have increased by many multiples over the past 18 months. ” It acknowledged that wholesale markets have fallen in recent months, but said they remain at levels far higher than before the energy crisis. It said it has bought forward wholesale energy supplies, so-called hedging arrangements, and some of these will take 24 months to unwind. “Electric Ireland will continue to keep its prices under constant review, and is committed to providing customers with the best value possible across a broad range of products.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“As of 1 February 2023, Electric Ireland offers the lowest Estimated Annual Bill for electricity on the market,” the company said. Electric Ireland said it was foregoing profit from its residential electricity business this year and has given a €50 credit to Electric Ireland residential electricity customers. Its Hardship Fund was also increased by €2m to €5m, it said.</p>', '01-Electric%20Ireland.png', '2023-02-27', '12:58:00', 1),
(2, 'Jen Kirby', 'The last US-Russia arms control treaty is in big trouble', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers his annual state of the nation address at the Gostiny Dvor conference centre in central Moscow on February 21, 2023.', '<p>The last standing nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the United States is in deep danger. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week that Russia was “suspending” its participation in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, which limits the number of deployed long-range nuclear weapons for each country. Putin made the announcement in a speech marking the first year of his war in Ukraine, and he effectively tied his decision to the conflict, saying Washington wants “to inflict a strategic defeat on us and claim our nuclear facilities.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Putin’s decision is a distressing signal not just for New START but for global arms control and nonproliferation more broadly. Russia and the United States have the world’s largest nuclear weapons arsenals, and a pact like New START should serve as a safeguard during moments of tension, rather than a tool in a geopolitical standoff.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>New START specifically caps the number of long-range missiles each country can deploy to 1,550 and allows for a maximum of 700 long-range missiles and bombers.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>It all sounds very technical, but strategic nuclear arms are “the big intercontinental systems that are essentially an existential threat — not only to the United States and to the Russian Federation, but to the global community, to humanity as a whole,” said Rose Gottemoeller, who served as the chief negotiator in the Obama administration for the New START Treaty and is now the Steven C. Házy Lecturer at Stanford University.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Russia has said it is going to continue to follow the limits set out by New START — in other words, according to Moscow, it’s not going to amass more warheads. But beyond the nuke limits, New START has formal mechanisms for data-sharing and verification — including inspections — which gave both the US and Russia transparency into what the other was doing, and brought stability and predictability to the nuclear relationship. The Biden administration renewed the pact with Russia in 2021, but the agreement is set to expire in 2026 unless a new deal can be negotiated. The prospects for a new agreement were already pretty grim, even before the Ukraine war poisoned US-Russia relations even further. And Russia had been gumming up the pact even before Putin’s announcement this week. Inspections were paused during the pandemic, but Russia has continued to block them, most recently claiming that US sanctions are preventing Russian officials from conducting checks. (The US State Department says that’s not true.) Russia also bailed on technical talks, linking that to the US’s weapons support for Ukraine.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Russia’s so-called suspension isn’t actually a legal possibility under the treaty — but, then again, this isn’t exactly a good faith effort. Instead, Putin is trying to use New START as a bargaining chip in the Ukraine war. It’s another way for him “to impose costs or risks on the United States and the West, basically, saying: ‘We know you value this arms control treaty, but if you continue supporting Ukraine the way you are, you can say goodbye to that treaty’ — or he’s at least kind of hinting at the possibility that that could happen down the road,” said Nicholas Miller, nonproliferation expert and associate professor of government at Dartmouth University.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Putin has also used nuclear threats during the Ukraine war. The suspension of New START follows that playbook — an attempt to raise fears in the West about what Russia might do — in an effort to force the US and its partners to back off their support for Ukraine.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Russia’s decision “deeply unfortunate and irresponsible,” but made it clear that the US wants to engage with Russia on arms control at any time, “irrespective of anything else going on in the world or in our relationship.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>In the past, Washington and Moscow have tried to separate talks on strategic nuclear arms from other issues, even if the rest of the relationship was a mess. That seems much less of a possibility now, which is troubling for the US and Russia — and the entire world.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>What happens if New START stops?\r\nNew START is the last of the bilateral arms control pacts between Washington and Moscow, as the rest of the architecture built from the Cold War onward unravels. New START was negotiated in the early years of the Obama administration, and officially went into force in February 2011. The treaty was set to expire in February 2021, but President Joe Biden and Putin agreed to extend it for five years, until February 2026, its current termination date. Putin has put the existing New START in jeopardy. The prospects of a follow-on treaty, however, were already pretty precarious even before the Ukraine war and Putin’s New START decision. “The pathway that we’re on is no different, but the slope is steeper,” said Amy Woolf, nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former specialist on nuclear weapons at the Congressional Research Service.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The arms control agenda between Washington and Moscow has been stalled for some time; Russia and the US want different things. Also, any new New START would need to be approved by the US Senate with a two-thirds majority, and good luck with that in the current US political environment.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“We’ve known for 10 years that our lists are very different, and we’ve been unable to reach any agreement on what should be on the table,” said Woolf. “If you think that Ukraine caused the problem, all Ukraine did was highlight the fact that there was already a problem.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Both the US and Moscow had been chipping away at the arms control regime in recent years. The Trump administration withdrew from agreements, including the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) and the Open Skies Treaty, which allowed for unarmed reconnaissance flights. The US had valid claims of Russian noncompliance, but both ended and left a vacuum behind. Some experts worry that this is Putin’s current modus operandi around New START: don’t comply, trample on the treaty, and force the US to withdraw, allowing Putin to blame Washington for tearing up the pact.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>So far, the United States’ tack has been to say they’re disappointed in Moscow but still open to finding a way out of this jam. Exactly what that means for the treaty going forward is unclear, but the most immediate risk is that both sides get a lot less clarity about what the other is doing with their nuclear arsenal. And we’ll know if that concern materializes pretty soon: The treaty calls for a biannual data exchange, and the next one is due March 1.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>But even beyond that, New START provides both sides updates about what the other is doing — for example, if someone’s conducting a test or the US moves a missile out of a silo for repairs, it has to notify Russia about it. “Over time, that gives the Russians a great 24/7 view of the status and US Strategic Force posture,” Gottemoeller said. “That’s important for their security, it’s important for their stability; they understand exactly what’s going on in the US strategic nuclear arsenal.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The same is true for the United States, of course. Once those updates don’t happen, the US and Russia will likely have to use other means to verify nuke limits. That is time-consuming, probably not as accurate (although New START allows both parties to use “national technical means” — like satellites — to verify information, and neither party is supposed to interfere with those), and also much more expensive. New START is “cost-saving,” said Jessica Rogers, impact fellow at the Federation of American Scientists. “You can use those resources for other things, or for other defense purposes.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Without that information, the pressure could grow on both sides to build up the nuclear arsenals.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“Confidence in what’s going on in the Russian force will degrade. The voices arguing for an expansion of the US force because of what Russia is doing and what China’s doing will grow louder. And Russia will see what we’re doing and their voices to expand will grow louder,” said Woolf. “It’s a cascading effect over time — it’s not a concern that next week will pop out with an extra 1,000 warheads. That’s not going to happen.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Experts caution that a buildup by Russia is probably not an immediate threat. That takes time and money, and Russia has a lot going on. Again, at least for now, Putin has said that Russia will not increase its strategic nuclear arsenal beyond the current New START limits.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>But even if an arms race isn’t an urgent worry, the potential for an arms free-for-all exists — not just between the US and Russia, but also China and other nuclear powers. Putin’s weakening of New START starts this process, and the treaty expiring might accelerate it.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“If 2026 rolls around and there’s no replacement, then there is a possibility that each country could substantially upload more nuclear weapons,” said Shannon Bugos, senior policy analyst at the Arms Control Association.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>A grim moment for global arms control, in a series of tough moments\r\nA renewed and unrestrained arms race is not an inevitable conclusion, but as the arms control regime erodes, the greater the risk becomes over time.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>And if that happens now, it is not a reprise of the Cold War, with two superpowers, Russia and the United States, locked in competition. It is a much more multipolar world. Iran is inching closer to enriching weapons-grade uranium (something facilitated by the US throwing out the Iran Nuclear Deal). Even US allies like South Korea are more publicly debating getting nuclear weapons, worried about the threat from North Korea’s program.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>But most critically, China, another superpower, is also in the mix. Beijing’s strategic nuclear arsenal is still far below either the US or Russia’s, but it is likely trying to build closer to their levels over the next decades — strategic nuclear arms levels currently fenced in by New START. If Russia and the US throw off the remaining restraints, it removes some of the incentive for China (who has been reluctant to engage bilaterally or multilaterally on arms control), or anyone else, to follow suit.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>And once countries start down an arms-race path, it is hard to get off the ride. Trust is broken, and getting any agreement on arms control is much harder if tensions among parties are high. Once you invest in building up a nuclear arsenal, it’s not easy to shift, and it’s not cheap to dismantle nuclear warheads, either. And even if you’re a country that thinks some 1,500 strategic nuclear weapons is enough for your defense, sitting out an arms race with an adversary is a pretty hard sell when it comes to domestic politics.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Again, this is not happening at this moment, but chipping away at pacts like New START make that all the more possible. And often it takes a near-catastrophe — say, a Cuban missile crisis — for countries to acknowledge it’s in their national security interest to do arms control.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>If anything, the Ukraine war should prove the need for Russia and the US to sit down on strategic arms, no matter what else. After all, that’s the point of these kinds of arms control treaties: They are supposed to provide guardrails when geopolitics are at a fever pitch because they help maintain a level of mutual trust and transparency that protects against miscalculation. They restrain powers when the impulse would be the opposite.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Which is also what’s so dangerous about Putin’s New START tactics. He is explicitly linking it to the US’s support for Ukraine in the war, which as Rogers pointed out, imperils not just arms control but international law more broadly.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Putin isn’t the only president who’s used treaties as a form of politics, but it adds to an alarming norm. By wielding New START as a cudgel, Putin is trying to escalate the nuclear risk, and get the US and the West to reverse their backing for Ukraine. That ultimately makes the conflict more dangerous, adding uncertainty and even more mistrust — this time around weapons of mass destruction.</p>', '02-The%20last%20US-Russia%20arms.png', '2023-02-25', '11:30:00', 1),
(3, 'Rachel DuRose', 'What can the world learn from China’s “zero-Covid” lockdown?', 'Volunteers deliver food supplies to residents at a gated community after Shanghai imposed a citywide lockdown to halt the spread of Covid-19 on April 8, 2022 in Shanghai, China.', '<p>For the first time in three years, millions traveled within China earlier this month to reunite with loved ones for the country’s most important holiday, the Lunar New Year. Unfortunately, these celebrations coincided with — and are sure to exacerbate — a Covid-19 outbreak currently spreading throughout the country. This spike comes on the heels of China’s National Health Commission ending many of its “zero-Covid” policies in December. These public health regulations had heavily restricted travel within and to the country, quarantined infected individuals in government-run facilities, and enforced city-wide lockdowns that required millions to stay indoors for months at a time. While the US threw the term “lockdown” around in the early stages of the pandemic, China was one of the few countries that actually did lock down its population.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>These initiatives did prevent repeated surges in Covid-19 cases. But it also led to inadequate responses to other health crises and emergencies — including a November 2022 building fire in the Xinjiang region where virus-related blockades prevented an effective emergency response. Protests over the last few months of 2022 bubbled across major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Urumqi, calling for an end to lockdowns, censorship, and in some cases, even Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s presidency.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Beijing’s decision to end zero-Covid policies may have saved the nation from further social chaos. But how it eased up resulted in a public health crisis, with an estimated 2.02 million government-confirmed Covid-19 cases (though that’s likely an undercount) as of January 29, compared to 119,836 cumulative cases a year ago.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Although a variety of zero-Covid strategies have been tried in different countries since the start of the pandemic, they have varied in intensity, length, goals, and outcomes. In some nations, lockdowns were used intermittently to control outbreaks and to give public health leaders time to develop and distribute vaccinations. China’s lockdowns were used as a primary prevention measure. Partially, China’s current outbreak stems from the country’s all-or-nothing mentality, experts told Vox. The country eased lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mass testing, all at once — and the virus came rushing in. Lockdowns aren’t a popular public health strategy when strung out for long periods of time. But that doesn’t mean they can’t be a useful option in the pandemic playbook. Lockdowns cannot contain a disease like Covid-19 indefinitely — especially more contagious variants — but they can mitigate the spread and give public health leaders time to prepare for other aspects of their pandemic response, such as vaccinations. The public health lessons learned from the end of China’s zero-Covid era might be some of the most important in preparing for future pandemics and learning how to live with diseases.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“At the beginning [of a pandemic], if there’s no treatment, no vaccine, and we have very limited knowledge about this new phenomena, a lockdown is more acceptable,” said Jennifer Bouey, chair of the global health department at Georgetown University. “Once there are vaccines, once there’s treatment, once we understand the nature of the pathogen, then they should be switched to a combination of different things.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Lockdowns worked during SARS. China hoped they would work again.\r\nIn January 2020, only two days before the Lunar New Year, China banned travel to and from the 11 million-person city of Wuhan because of the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus, soon known as Covid-19. In March, as the threat of the virus grew, other countries closed their borders, with the World Health Organization declaring Covid-19 a pandemic.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Many countries, including China, adopted true lockdowns as a means to stamp out the Covid-19 virus. These measures quarantined infected and exposed individuals, and locked down entire buildings, cities, and regions.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>China had reason to believe this strategy would work again, given that during the outbreak of SARS — now called the SARS-CoV-1 virus — in the early 2000s, the nation used a citywide lockdown of Beijing in 2003 to contain the disease. “People didn’t go out for six weeks, school was canceled, the streets were empty, and the epidemic ended,” said Elanah Uretsky, chair of international and global studies at Brandeis University, of China’s SARS response. “It ended because of those lockdowns and massive quarantine policies. And we learned to believe in them.” In the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, little was known about how the virus spread, so public health guidance changed constantly. The application and length of lockdowns varied by country. In France, there were clear guidelines that allowed residents to travel outdoors for activities such as walking a pet. In contrast, in Wuhan, only one member of a household was permitted outside every two days to buy necessary resources. New Zealand, an island country with a zero-Covid approach, prevented Covid cases and deaths early in the pandemic by closing its borders.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>However, Covid-19 proved to be more “elusive” than SARS, said Uretsky. Covid can present asymptomatically — unlike SARS — and therefore it can evade some contact tracing protocols. While it isn’t as deadly as SARS, Covid is more transmissible, meaning that one person infects multiple people at a higher rate.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, it was difficult for countries with large populations and land masses, such as the US and China, to have the type of nationally coordinated response seen in smaller island nations like Singapore and New Zealand. Given its size and politics, the US was unable to nationally coordinate the country’s Covid response and instead relied on individual regions or states to dictate public health measures.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Instead of zero-Covid, the US opted for a strategy of “flattening the curve,” which entailed decelerating the rate of Covid-19 infection to ease the burden on hospitals. “I think China’s massive error, considering that their population is enormous, was not doing what many countries did, or strived to do, which was ‘flatten the curve,’” said Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist with the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>In mid-2021, even nations that had maintained low case numbers and death rates through lockdowns adjusted their policies, and instead focused on vaccination campaigns and ramping up contact tracing efforts. Wealthy nations with access to vaccines began immunizing their populations in December 2020, and by the end of August 2021, over 2 billion people were fully vaccinated. Over the last year and a half, many former zero-Covid countries prioritized administering booster vaccines and slowly phased out contact tracing protocols. Meanwhile, in China, the nation’s zero-Covid policies dragged on for two years. The nation was able to keep cases low, relative to its population, until March 2022. At that time, the omicron variant of the virus swept through the country, leading to a lockdown in the 25 million-person city of Shanghai for two months. This extended lockdown sparked anger among residents and would add fuel to the growing anti-government sentiments that manifested via protests later that year.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Why China’s post-zero-Covid era is going so poorly\r\nAfter over 150 partial and full city-wide lockdowns and months-long protests, China released new Covid-19 guidelines in early November and early December that softened or reversed earlier zero-Covid practices. In November, the guidelines cut down isolation time, removed mass testing sites, and increased resources to health care facilities. In December, health codes (proving lack of Covid exposure or a negative test result) to enter most public spaces were no longer required and infected individuals with mild or no symptoms could quarantine at home rather than at government-run facilities.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>However, China lifted these policies not because it was prepared to do so, but because of political pressure from the nationwide protests, said Ha-Linh Quach, a research assistant at Duke NUS medical school in Singapore. Quach — who also previously worked with Vietnam’s National Committee of Covid-19 — said Vietnam followed China’s lead when attempting to manage the spread of the virus, but also found that mass quarantines were publicly unpopular. Instead, in 2021 the country began prioritizing social distancing, mask-wearing policies, and vaccine distribution.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Unlike other countries — like Taiwan, South Korea, or Singapore — that used periods of strict lockdowns to prepare for their inevitable reopening, and the internal travel that it would spawn, China did no such thing, said Uretsky.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Rather than reopening in stages, China lifted many of its most useful measures all at once — despite the fact that prior to easing these regulations, Covid cases were already on the rise. “Unfortunately for China, lack of preparation for the inevitable breach of an increasingly infectious pathogen results in exactly what we’re seeing,” said Miller.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>For example, alongside these eased regulations, China announced it would ramp up its vaccination of the elderly, something the experts Vox spoke to say should have happened much earlier. When the restrictions were lifted, only 40 percent of Chinese residents above the age of 80 had received a Covid-19 booster shot, according to China’s National Health Commission.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Other countries that exited periods of intense lockdowns, such as Vietnam, not only used vaccines to prepare, but also bolstered their social distancing policies and contact tracing programs as they transitioned, said Quach.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>As part of its zero-Covid policies, China used a digital health code system that assigned users QR codes based on their exposure and testing status, and that were needed to enter public spaces. Now, these codes are no longer required to access many public areas or to travel in China.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Yet Singapore, when the nation lifted many of its zero-Covid policies in June 2021, continued to use its version of these health codes for almost a year. These codes helped Singapore track down those who were exposed to someone with Covid-19 at an expedited rate. “It is not a breakthrough technology,” Quach said. “But it’s amazing to me how it is being used for public health.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>That said, these codes, while effective in the small nation of Singapore, had limited success in China due to the country’s size and lack of data-sharing. “On paper, it can work, but it’s very difficult to implement in the real world, especially in such a large country,” said Bouey. “It turns out that every province is doing their own work, and they’re not integrated. So when people travel from one province to another, the code suddenly doesn’t work.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Lack of data and rampant misinformation have also exacerbated China’s post-lockdown problems. The current outbreak is thought to have begun in November 2022, and although the official number of total Covid-19 deaths in China, as of January 30, is now over 110,000 — which would still be low relative to the nation’s 1.4 billion population — the true figures are thought to be much higher. One model from December predicted that as many as 1 million people could die from Covid in China over the first few months of the year, but without transparent information from Beijing, these forecasts remain speculative.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“In the absence of data, there is misinformation,” Miller said. “I think the seeds of the spread of Covid were already happening in China. But the information as to the extent of it and the location of it would have allowed people to make informed decisions. In the absence of that, people are making whatever decision they want to make.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>What this teaches us for the next pandemic\r\nAssuming another unknown virus will spread across the globe again in our lifetimes, the Covid-19 pandemic has given public health leaders fresh insight into what policies can be most effective in mitigating the spread of diseases. And lockdowns, when used appropriately and swiftly, remain a useful tool in our arsenal for early pandemic days.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Covid-19 was actually the “ideal candidate” for lockdowns, said Miller. This is because of the virus’s highly transmissible, airborne, and often asymptomatic nature. “Candidates for lockdown include pathogens that are novel to human populations, and therefore there is no innate immunity to them,” Miller said. “Highly infectious pathogens for which there are (currently) no vaccines or treatments are also candidates for lockdown.” In theory, the only type of diseases that lockdowns cannot mitigate are those that are not transmitted via human-to-human contact, such as water or foodborne illnesses, said Bouey.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Lockdowns give leaders time to develop vaccination distribution campaigns, set up contact tracing programs, and learn more about the pandemic-causing disease, Miller added.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>This is why it’s important to distinguish between “short-term lockdowns with underlying goals” and “long-term lockdowns that hope to beat the odds and keep Covid out indefinitely,” said Miller. Brief lockdowns that helped “flatten the curve” were effective and helped keep hospitalizations and deaths down. But extended lockdowns, like the ones seen in China, failed to contain the virus and damaged the country’s economy and well-being.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“As we have seen, these lockdowns are very disruptive, in terms of economic livelihood, as well as social life and even mental health,” said Bouey. “There is profound damage to the society and to the economy.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>This spike comes on the heels of China’s National Health Commission ending many of its “zero-Covid” policies in December. These public health regulations had heavily restricted travel within and to the country, quarantined infected individuals in government-run facilities, and enforced city-wide lockdowns that required millions to stay indoors for months at a time. While the US threw the term “lockdown” around in the early stages of the pandemic, China was one of the few countries that actually did lock down its population.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>These initiatives did prevent repeated surges in Covid-19 cases. But it also led to inadequate responses to other health crises and emergencies — including a November 2022 building fire in the Xinjiang region where virus-related blockades prevented an effective emergency response. Protests over the last few months of 2022 bubbled across major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Urumqi, calling for an end to lockdowns, censorship, and in some cases, even Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s presidency.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Beijing’s decision to end zero-Covid policies may have saved the nation from further social chaos. But how it eased up resulted in a public health crisis, with an estimated 2.02 million government-confirmed Covid-19 cases (though that’s likely an undercount) as of January 29, compared to 119,836 cumulative cases a year ago.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Although a variety of zero-Covid strategies have been tried in different countries since the start of the pandemic, they have varied in intensity, length, goals, and outcomes. In some nations, lockdowns were used intermittently to control outbreaks and to give public health leaders time to develop and distribute vaccinations. China’s lockdowns were used as a primary prevention measure. Partially, China’s current outbreak stems from the country’s all-or-nothing mentality, experts told Vox. The country eased lockdowns, travel restrictions, and mass testing, all at once — and the virus came rushing in. Lockdowns aren’t a popular public health strategy when strung out for long periods of time. But that doesn’t mean they can’t be a useful option in the pandemic playbook. Lockdowns cannot contain a disease like Covid-19 indefinitely — especially more contagious variants — but they can mitigate the spread and give public health leaders time to prepare for other aspects of their pandemic response, such as vaccinations. The public health lessons learned from the end of China’s zero-Covid era might be some of the most important in preparing for future pandemics and learning how to live with diseases.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“At the beginning [of a pandemic], if there’s no treatment, no vaccine, and we have very limited knowledge about this new phenomena, a lockdown is more acceptable,” said Jennifer Bouey, chair of the global health department at Georgetown University. “Once there are vaccines, once there’s treatment, once we understand the nature of the pathogen, then they should be switched to a combination of different things.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Lockdowns worked during SARS. China hoped they would work again.\r\nIn January 2020, only two days before the Lunar New Year, China banned travel to and from the 11 million-person city of Wuhan because of the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus, soon known as Covid-19. In March, as the threat of the virus grew, other countries closed their borders, with the World Health Organization declaring Covid-19 a pandemic.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Many countries, including China, adopted true lockdowns as a means to stamp out the Covid-19 virus. These measures quarantined infected and exposed individuals, and locked down entire buildings, cities, and regions.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>China had reason to believe this strategy would work again, given that during the outbreak of SARS — now called the SARS-CoV-1 virus — in the early 2000s, the nation used a citywide lockdown of Beijing in 2003 to contain the disease. “People didn’t go out for six weeks, school was canceled, the streets were empty, and the epidemic ended,” said Elanah Uretsky, chair of international and global studies at Brandeis University, of China’s SARS response. “It ended because of those lockdowns and massive quarantine policies. And we learned to believe in them.” In the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, little was known about how the virus spread, so public health guidance changed constantly. The application and length of lockdowns varied by country. In France, there were clear guidelines that allowed residents to travel outdoors for activities such as walking a pet. In contrast, in Wuhan, only one member of a household was permitted outside every two days to buy necessary resources. New Zealand, an island country with a zero-Covid approach, prevented Covid cases and deaths early in the pandemic by closing its borders.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>However, Covid-19 proved to be more “elusive” than SARS, said Uretsky. Covid can present asymptomatically — unlike SARS — and therefore it can evade some contact tracing protocols. While it isn’t as deadly as SARS, Covid is more transmissible, meaning that one person infects multiple people at a higher rate.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, it was difficult for countries with large populations and land masses, such as the US and China, to have the type of nationally coordinated response seen in smaller island nations like Singapore and New Zealand. Given its size and politics, the US was unable to nationally coordinate the country’s Covid response and instead relied on individual regions or states to dictate public health measures.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Instead of zero-Covid, the US opted for a strategy of “flattening the curve,” which entailed decelerating the rate of Covid-19 infection to ease the burden on hospitals. “I think China’s massive error, considering that their population is enormous, was not doing what many countries did, or strived to do, which was ‘flatten the curve,’” said Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist with the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>In mid-2021, even nations that had maintained low case numbers and death rates through lockdowns adjusted their policies, and instead focused on vaccination campaigns and ramping up contact tracing efforts. Wealthy nations with access to vaccines began immunizing their populations in December 2020, and by the end of August 2021, over 2 billion people were fully vaccinated. Over the last year and a half, many former zero-Covid countries prioritized administering booster vaccines and slowly phased out contact tracing protocols. Meanwhile, in China, the nation’s zero-Covid policies dragged on for two years. The nation was able to keep cases low, relative to its population, until March 2022. At that time, the omicron variant of the virus swept through the country, leading to a lockdown in the 25 million-person city of Shanghai for two months. This extended lockdown sparked anger among residents and would add fuel to the growing anti-government sentiments that manifested via protests later that year.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Why China’s post-zero-Covid era is going so poorly\r\nAfter over 150 partial and full city-wide lockdowns and months-long protests, China released new Covid-19 guidelines in early November and early December that softened or reversed earlier zero-Covid practices. In November, the guidelines cut down isolation time, removed mass testing sites, and increased resources to health care facilities. In December, health codes (proving lack of Covid exposure or a negative test result) to enter most public spaces were no longer required and infected individuals with mild or no symptoms could quarantine at home rather than at government-run facilities.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>However, China lifted these policies not because it was prepared to do so, but because of political pressure from the nationwide protests, said Ha-Linh Quach, a research assistant at Duke NUS medical school in Singapore. Quach — who also previously worked with Vietnam’s National Committee of Covid-19 — said Vietnam followed China’s lead when attempting to manage the spread of the virus, but also found that mass quarantines were publicly unpopular. Instead, in 2021 the country began prioritizing social distancing, mask-wearing policies, and vaccine distribution.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Unlike other countries — like Taiwan, South Korea, or Singapore — that used periods of strict lockdowns to prepare for their inevitable reopening, and the internal travel that it would spawn, China did no such thing, said Uretsky.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Rather than reopening in stages, China lifted many of its most useful measures all at once — despite the fact that prior to easing these regulations, Covid cases were already on the rise. “Unfortunately for China, lack of preparation for the inevitable breach of an increasingly infectious pathogen results in exactly what we’re seeing,” said Miller.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>For example, alongside these eased regulations, China announced it would ramp up its vaccination of the elderly, something the experts Vox spoke to say should have happened much earlier. When the restrictions were lifted, only 40 percent of Chinese residents above the age of 80 had received a Covid-19 booster shot, according to China’s National Health Commission.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Other countries that exited periods of intense lockdowns, such as Vietnam, not only used vaccines to prepare, but also bolstered their social distancing policies and contact tracing programs as they transitioned, said Quach.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>As part of its zero-Covid policies, China used a digital health code system that assigned users QR codes based on their exposure and testing status, and that were needed to enter public spaces. Now, these codes are no longer required to access many public areas or to travel in China.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Yet Singapore, when the nation lifted many of its zero-Covid policies in June 2021, continued to use its version of these health codes for almost a year. These codes helped Singapore track down those who were exposed to someone with Covid-19 at an expedited rate. “It is not a breakthrough technology,” Quach said. “But it’s amazing to me how it is being used for public health.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>That said, these codes, while effective in the small nation of Singapore, had limited success in China due to the country’s size and lack of data-sharing. “On paper, it can work, but it’s very difficult to implement in the real world, especially in such a large country,” said Bouey. “It turns out that every province is doing their own work, and they’re not integrated. So when people travel from one province to another, the code suddenly doesn’t work.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Lack of data and rampant misinformation have also exacerbated China’s post-lockdown problems. The current outbreak is thought to have begun in November 2022, and although the official number of total Covid-19 deaths in China, as of January 30, is now over 110,000 — which would still be low relative to the nation’s 1.4 billion population — the true figures are thought to be much higher. One model from December predicted that as many as 1 million people could die from Covid in China over the first few months of the year, but without transparent information from Beijing, these forecasts remain speculative.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“In the absence of data, there is misinformation,” Miller said. “I think the seeds of the spread of Covid were already happening in China. But the information as to the extent of it and the location of it would have allowed people to make informed decisions. In the absence of that, people are making whatever decision they want to make.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>What this teaches us for the next pandemic\r\nAssuming another unknown virus will spread across the globe again in our lifetimes, the Covid-19 pandemic has given public health leaders fresh insight into what policies can be most effective in mitigating the spread of diseases.

(4, 'Nicole Narea and Li Zhou ', 'Lawyers won’t compromise on police reform.', 'New calls for police reform face old Democratic and Republican divisions in Congress.', '<p>The release of footage on Friday of Memphis police violently beating Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who died from his injuries three days later, has renewed calls to pass federal police reform. But with the House of Representatives now in Republican hands and a closely divided Senate, the prospect for any such reform remains unlikely.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Chief among the existing proposals is Democrats’ George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed the then-Democratic controlled House in 2021 without a single Republican vote, but failed in the Senate.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Ben Crump, a lawyer for the Nichols family, has publicly urged Congress to pass the bill, saying in an interview with CNN Sunday that he hoped Nichols’s death would prove to be a turning point. Democrats have echoed that sentiment, either rallying behind that bill specifically or calling for further bipartisan negotiations in the hopes of reaching a compromise that has a chance of passing.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Both Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Tim Scott (R-SC), who led unsuccessful negotiations on a police reform package in 2021, seemed receptive to giving bipartisan talks another chance in statements Friday. Booker said that he would “never stop working to build a broad coalition” necessary to pass policing reform, and Scott said that Nichols’s death should be a “call to action for every lawmaker in our nation at every level.” The Congressional Black Caucus has called, too, for both a meeting with President Joe Biden and a robust push for national criminal justice reforms.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Still, many Republicans have expressed opposition to key reforms proposed by Democrats, including limitations on qualified immunity, which protects officers from certain lawsuits. Others dismissed the need for reform at the federal level at all. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), for instance, said in an interview with NBC that, “Democrats always think that it’s a new law that’s going to fix something that terrible. We kind of think that … no new law is going to do that.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>While a divided Congress, particularly one with a slim Democratic Senate majority, makes a bipartisan policing bill unlikely, new legislation isn’t impossible: Tragedy has galvanized bipartisan action on divisive topics in the recent past.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>In December, two years after George Floyd was killed by police, Congress passed a law that supports deescalation training for law enforcement officers dealing with individuals who have mental health issues. And after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last year, Congress passed its first federal gun safety law in nearly three decades, making strides in preventing guns from falling into the hands of dangerous individuals.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Both of those bills fell far short of a panacea to the epidemics of violence they aimed to address, but they represented incremental progress. So far, however, further compromise on police reform has proved elusive.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Why police reform has been at an impasse\r\nPolice reform has long been stalled in Congress for a simple reason: disagreements between Republicans and Democrats over how comprehensive such legislation should be. In 2020, in the wake of George Floyd’s murder and massive protests of law enforcement and racism, both parties introduced their own versions of legislation.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The Democratic version, the aforementioned George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, would lower the legal standard by which law enforcement officers can face criminal prosecution for misconduct and limit their protection from civil liability under qualified immunity, as well as curb federal officers’ ability to use force, no-knock warrants, chokeholds, and carotid holds. It would also establish new reporting requirements, a new national database on police misconduct, and national accreditation standards for law enforcement agencies under which officers would be trained on racial profiling, implicit bias, and their duty to intervene when another officer uses excessive force, among other provisions.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Republicans’ bill — the JUSTICE Act — focused heavily on data collection about police use of force and more documentation of police misconduct, and was much narrower than Democrats’ proposal.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Qualified immunity, in particular, has consistently been a major sticking point between the two parties, with Democrats determined to end such protections, and Republicans arguing that doing so would leave police officers too vulnerable to liability. Under existing law, qualified immunity makes it challenging to file civil suits against police officers for harms they’ve caused unless there was a prior case deeming those exact same harms illegal or unconstitutional. As a result, police officers have not been held accountable in multiple cases when they have killed people, caused serious injuries, and damaged property.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>One compromise floated by Scott, though it never materialized in legislation, was the idea that instead of holding individual officers liable for harms, police departments would be held liable, in a way to take the pressure off individuals while still increasing accountability. Sen. Lindsey Graham, in a tweet this week, once again referenced this idea, noting that “holding police departments accountable makes sense.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Broadly, the federal government faces limitations when it comes to how much it can address policing practices, since most departments operate at the state and local level, and are governed by those laws. Those limits were reflected in some of the commonalities between the previous Democratic and Republican bills, both of which tried to use federal dollars to encourage policy changes the US government couldn’t mandate. For instance, both conditioned grant money to state and local law enforcement agencies based on whether they eliminated chokeholds.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>One other key area of overlap between the two bills was a requirement that regional agencies do a better job reporting use of force to the Justice Department. That could also be a starting point for new negotiations.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Booker, Scott, and former Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA) — now mayor of Los Angeles — previously led negotiations in Congress on the legislation. In September 2021, talks on police reform collapsed due to the parties’ differences. Those same divides remain, and given the current makeup of Congress, it’s likely that any police reform that could advance would be much narrower and even tougher to pass.</p>', '04-Lawmakers%20won’t%20compromise.png', '2023-01-30', '20:50:00', 1),

However, campaigners are extremely concerned that it will lead to the inhumane and costly detention of tens of thousands of refugees. The only safe routes currently available to those wishing to seek asylum in the UK are through limited schemes for Ukraine, Afghanistan and Hong Kong.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Former Conservative ministers and an ex-permanent secretary of the Home Office, Sir David Normington, cast doubts on the feasibility of the plans, especially without any agreement with France aimed at preventing small boats setting off or reaching the UK.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>One former minister said: “The proposals, if you believe the briefings and the leaks, are a joke and I just cannot see how they will get on to the statute. They look like an attempt to go into the general election with some clear blue water between us and Labour. Propose a hardline law, have it stopped by the EU and the courts, blame lefty lawyers and Labour for being soft on immigration.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>They added: “The idea that the governments under Boris [Johnson] and Theresa [May] just failed to see this easy fix of circumventing laws with another law, without years of legal wrangling, just doesn’t wash.” Another former minister said that the proposals will face a backlash from Conservative MPs from both wings of the party. “Many will not want to see extended detentions, while others who were in the military will feel deeply uncomfortable seeing Afghan comrades labelled as ‘illegal’ because they could not get here via a safe route. It is not plain sailing.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Other Conservative MPs who have criticised previous plans in relation to Rwanda said they had been assured by No 10 that the new proposals were “compatible with the law” but they would wait to see the final legislation before passing judgment.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Normington told Times Radio: “I really don’t see how the prime minister’s objectives are going to be achieved. Obviously, he’s going to pass some legislation first, and there may be more to it than we have heard. But unless you manage the system properly, the legislation will be ineffective.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Under the proposals, those who claim asylum are expected to face being kept for up to 28 days in detention facilities, one source said. They said the new laws could also apply equally to those under 18, even if they travel to the UK alone.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>If everyone who crossed the Channel last year was detained for 28 days, on 4 September 9,161 people would have been detained, the Refugee Council said – four times the current detention estate capacity of 2,286.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, hinted on Sunday that there would be “more safe and legal routes” for refugees to come to the UK alongside the legislation, but the government has previously suggested this could be delayed until small boat crossings have been curbed.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The British Red Cross called the plans “extremely concerning”, while Labour accused Sunak of reheating the proposals in last year’s failed nationality and borders bill. The Liberal Democrats said it was “another half baked plan that will punish the victims of human trafficking” and called for “safe and legal routes for asylum seekers” as a priority.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The UN high commissioner for refugees has previously said a blanket ban on claiming asylum in the UK for those arriving on small boats would breach the Refugee Convention. In relation to a thinktank report suggesting such a move, the UNHCR said in December: “Everybody has the right to seek asylum from persecution in another country, and there is no such thing as an ‘illegal asylum-seeker’. “The indefinite detention of those seeking asylum, based solely on their mode of arrival, would punish people in need of help and protection and constitute a clear breach of the United Kingdom’s obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>A number of Conservative MPs have previously criticised any plans that could lead the UK to withdraw from the European Convention of Human Rights. Other Tory MPs are concerned that the prime minister may have been too ambitious in promising to stop small boat crossings without an agreement with the French to turn people back.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Sunak and Suella Braverman, the home secretary, are due to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Friday this week. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: “Ministers have made countless claims and promises yet the facts show their last law badly failed and made things worse. Instead of learning lessons, it looks like they are still recycling the same rhetoric and failure.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“Labour is calling urgently for a major new cross-border police unit to go after the criminal gangs, fast track asylum decisions and returns, and a new agreement with France and Belgium that can stop the dangerous crossings.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Diana Johnson, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee, said the cross-party group has said it is “essential that any new policy announcements from the Home Office be evidence-based, fully costed and thought through in practical terms”.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“The committee has offered to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny on this bill, but the leader of the house [Penny Mordaunt] last week said that the government wanted to get on with it,” she added. “We will wait and see whether this new bill will actually deliver what the government promises.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda is still the subject of protracted legal challenges. Campaigners and asylum seekers will on Monday seek permission to widen their appeal against the high court’s ruling that the Rwanda plan is lawful. An appeal is expected to be heard before the court in April.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Some legal observers have claimed that the appeals process could continue for many months, and possibly into next year.</p>', '05-Rishi%20Sunak\'s%20plan.png', '2023-03-05', '19:10:00', 1),

Finance Ireland has the highest rate, a five-year fixed rate of 5.95pc, Ms Hennessy said. “A mortgage holder with Finance Ireland could switch to a five-year rate of 3.5pc, saving €351 per month on a €250,000 mortgage, or €21,060 over the five-year fixed term,” said Ms Hennessy. “Finance Ireland have recently announced a variable rate increase to 6.9pc from mid-March – a rate unseen in Ireland for over 20 years.” The lowest mortgage interest rate is now 1.2 percentage points higher than it was 12 months ago.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>This highlights the additional costs that will be incurred by mortgage holders exiting fixed rates, Ms Hennessy said. According to calculations done for the Irish Independent by the Doddl.ie mortgage switching index, mortgage holders rolling off a fixed term onto a variable rate of 5.15pc could save up to €3,952 a year by switching their mortgage. This is based on the average new mortgage draw down in the last quarter of just under €296,000. The saving can be made by opting for the lowest non-green rate on the market, which is currently 3.15pc. “It is now more important than ever that mortgage holders coming to the end of a fixed term seek out market-based advice when deciding on what their next rate should be,” said Ms Hennessy.</p>', '07-Thousands%20of%20homeowners.jpg', '2023-02-27', '02:30:00', 1),

Whatever his fellow writers on the show decide, the boss of HBO, the powerful entertainment production house based in Los Angeles, believes a sequel would not “seem a natural thing”.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Armstrong’s suggestion that he could go further with the show in a different format came after he revealed he was “conflicted” about his decision to terminate the seething machinations of the Roy family.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“I feel sad, and I have the circus-has-left-town feeling that everyone gets who works on a production that’s good, and this one particularly so,” he told The New Yorker last week. “I imagine I’ll be a little bit lonely, and wandering the streets of London in a funk.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The writer, who established his talent in Britain as co-creator of the Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show, said he had known where the story should end from around the second series, but admits it is, in some ways, a “perverse decision” to pull the plug on such a successful drama.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“I’ve never thought this could go on forever. The end has always been kind of present in my mind,” he said. “But the feeling there could be something else in an allied world, or allied characters, or some of the same characters – that’s also strong in me. Maybe there’s another part of this world we could come back to, if there was an appetite?” Bloys has indicated he has not conclusively ruled out the prospect of a new show. “I always say ‘never say never’ ,” he told Variety. If Armstrong were keen, he explained he would give him a fair hearing. The possibility of airing a Game of Thrones prequel has already broken a pattern for HBO and was initially unpopular, Bloys said. “I had some people internally saying, ‘This is crazy. What are you doing?’”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Armstrong’s decision to wave goodbye to Succession was motivated, he said, by his fear of disappointing his audience. “I hope that no one ever thinks that we are outstaying our welcome – that we’re going to do a dud season, or be stretching it out.

What a prospect Scotland’s next match – at home to Ireland – would have been, had they managed to ride the red card shown to Grant Gilchrist in the seventh minute and a 19-0 deficit at the end of the first quarter to complete the comeback. As it is, they pulled the score back to 25-21 with 12 minutes to go.

The aim, he said, was to “make our people suffer”, adding: “How can we ignore their nuclear capabilities in these conditions?”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Russia’s president said this alleged plot had been under way since the collapse of the USSR. “They tried to reshape the world exclusively on their terms. We had no choice but to react,” he said, adding that the west was complicit in Ukraine’s “crimes”.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>If Washington got its way, Russia would be divided into Moscow, the Urals, and other disparate regions, he said, claiming there was “written proof” for his assertion. Putin’s comments follow the first anniversary on Friday of Russia’s full-blown invasion of Ukraine. They are part of an apparent attempt to boost popular support for Moscow’s war of choice by recasting it as a necessary and defensive struggle for Russia’s national survival reminiscent of the Soviet Union’s battle against the Nazis.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The remarks come at a time when Russian troops have made local gains in Ukraine’s east but have failed to achieve a major breakthrough. Moscow’s military focus is to capture the entirety of the Donbas region, much of which remains under Kyiv’s control.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Russian tactical groups have partially encircled the city of Bakhmut, where fighting had raged for months. They were reportedly pressing from the north and south. The only road into the centre – a key Ukrainian supply route – is under Russian artillery fire.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military dismissed claims by Russia’s Wagner mercenary group that it had captured Yahidne, a village on Bakhmut’s northern outskirts. It said intense fighting was going on across the whole frontline.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>On Saturday the founder of the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his forces had taken Yahidne and the nearby village of Berkhivka. The latest Ukrainian update cited “unsuccessful” Russian offensives in the two settlements and four others. All were subject to heavy shelling, it said.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Unconfirmed reports on the Telegram channel suggested Ukrainian brigades had flooded the path of a Russian advance by blowing up a dam near Bakhmut. The Ukrainian army command used similar tactics last spring as part of its successful defence of Kyiv.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Ukraine’s military strategy is to hold the line in the Donbas region and to launch a counteroffensive once more western military hardware arrives, by late spring. The most likely direction is towards the occupied southern city of Melitopol and Crimea.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>In his latest message Volodymyr Zelenskiy reaffirmed his commitment to evict Russia from all Ukrainian territory it has stolen including Crimea. Putin annexed the peninsula nine years ago on Sunday using undercover special units nicknamed “little green men”.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Zelenskiy posted old photos of a pro-Ukrainian demonstration outside Crimea’s regional parliament in the now occupied city of Simferopol. Many of those who attended the rally were Tatars, Crimea’s original Muslim Turkic inhabitants, persecuted by Russia and its spy agencies since 2014, and previously by Stalin.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“Nine years ago, Russian aggression began in Crimea,” Zelenskiy wrote. “By returning Crimea, we will restore peace. This is our land. Our people. Our history. We will return the Ukrainian flag to every corner of Ukraine.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>He added: “Qırım serbest olacaq!” – “Crimea will be free!” in the Tatar language.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>It is unclear whether Ukraine’s western partners will support a large-scale Ukrainian military operation to seize back Crimea. There are unanswered questions, too, as to how Kyiv might reintegrate the area. Many pro-Ukrainian residents fled in 2014. Since then about 600,000 Russians have arrived.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>On Sunday Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said he was increasingly sympathetic to the idea Crimea should be returned. “I am leaning towards saying, yes, Crimea is Ukrainian territory and it therefore has to be given back,” he said in an interview. “But again: this is not a decision that’s up to us to take.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Pistorius said it was for Kyiv to choose when and under what conditions it would hold talks with Moscow. Zelenskiy has welcomed some aspects of a peace plan floated last week by China. But he has said no negotiations can take place until Russian troops get out fully from Ukraine.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Western leaders are sceptical over the proposal, and argue that Beijing does not have the international credibility to act as a mediator. Credible or not, China’s initiative may explain why in recent days Russia has launched no ballistic missile attacks on Kyiv, with the capital eerily quiet.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Speaking to ABC News, the US president, Joe Biden, dismissed Beijing’s plan. “I’ve seen nothing [that] would indicate there’s something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia,” he said. “The idea that China is gonna be negotiating the outcome of a war that’s a totally unjust war for Ukraine is just not rational.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>There have been unconfirmed reports that China is on the brink of supplying Moscow with kamikaze drones. Since October Russia has used Iranian-supplied drones to carry out regular attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>On Sunday the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said no lethal aid from China had reached Russia. He suggested any such move would have serious consequences.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“Beijing will have to make its own decisions about how it proceeds, whether it provides military assistance, but if it goes down that road, it will come at real costs to China,” Sullivan told CNN.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n <p>This article was amended on 27 February 2023.

Daveed (O\'Shea Jackson Jr.) and Eddie (Alden Ehrenreich) are sent by their boss Syd (Ray Liotta) to recover the cocaine before a local detective (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) finds it first. Meanwhile, a nurse (Keri Russell) enters the national park in search of her daughter, who\'s gone missing with her friend...\r\nWith a title like \'Cocaine Bear\', it\'s hard not to be automatically intrigued by the concept.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>So many movies nowadays are prequels, reboots, remakes, soft reboots, legacy sequels, so the idea of something reasonably fresh and original is always cause for excitement. \'Cocaine Bear\', given its period setting and its frequent outbursts of foul language and pitch-black comedy, attempts to harken back to the coked-up comedies of the \'80s-like \'Caddyshack\', \'48 Hrs.\', or \'Beverly Hills Cop\'. There\'s a sense of jagged energy about \'Cocaine Bear\' that few movies have nowadays, where making something slick and marketable isn\'t the first concern of anyone involved.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>To her credit, director Elizabeth Banks knows how to corral an ensemble cast and gives equal footing and pacing to them all. Alden Ehrenreich excels as a washed-up, depressed drug dealer with O\'Shea Jackson Jr. paired with him as the pragmatic and put-upon co-worker just trying to get to the end of the day alive. The great Margo Martindale and Jesse Tyler Ferguson both have an excellent dynamic as park rangers caught up in the bloody spectacle with horrifying results, and Isiah Whitlock Jr. and Ray Liotta both round out the cast in their own inimitable style. It\'s telling then that the poster and marketing material make little noise about this cast - it\'s the bear that\'s the impetus for it all.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Admittedly, the bear does look quite cheap and obvious in parts, not to mention more than a few scenes that are clearly trying to shoot around the mid-sized budget to make the most impact. Wicklow serves reasonably well as \'80s Georgia, with a tacky-looking kids\' restaurant and a housing estate serving for some of the exteriors as well as Avoca for the mountains themselves. All of this serves to heighten the kind of anarchic energy that \'Cocaine Bear\' feeds off of and carries through its tight 95-minute runtime.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Of course, as the title suggests, the effects are temporary, it eventually becomes annoying, and when you look back over the experience, you realise that much of it was just bluster and noise. \'Cocaine Bear\' is a quick, sugary bump of blood-soaked action and comedy. By no means a work of cinematic mastery, it\'s nevertheless an enjoyable tear through a tabloid story with more than a few embellishments worked into the bag to give it a kick.</p>', '13-Cocaine%20Bear.png', '2023-02-27', '17:30:00', 2),

Who has the time?', '<p>Here\'s a fun fact.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>In TV tropes, the opposite of jumping the shark - where a TV show has run its course and resorts to clownish situations to maintain interest - is growing the beard. Where does the term come from, you might ask? Every day is a school day here, folks. The term came from the third season of \'Star Trek: The Next Generation\', wherein Commander Riker - that\'s the tall guy who stood next to Captain Picard - grew a lovely swirl of facial hair on his chiseled, all-American jawline and this coincided with the show\'s quality drastically improving. This also occurred on \'Deep Space Nine\' too, where Commander Sisko shaved his head and grew out of beard. The idea is that a show has matured, its cast has matured, and it\'s growing in a more sophisticated direction.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>This doesn\'t apply to \'You\' Season 4, considering that Penn Badgley now has a beard. If anything, it\'s the opposite.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>In the world of streaming services, series now have a much shorter window to improve. A ropey first season normally means a perfunctory second season and then cancellation - or sometimes not at all. The only way a series survives in this jungle now is if it latches on to popular consciousness instantaneously. If it begins to lose its way after the fact, so be it, but it\'s got to wade through the endless tides of content out there and connect. \'You\' somehow managed this. Now in its fourth season, Penn Badgley has a beard. So has it hit its stride? Did it ever?</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\'You\' is bad television. There is no other way to describe it. The writing is more wooden than an entire forest. None of the dialogue is remotely believable. The constant narration becomes irritating after five minutes. There isn\'t an ounce of subtlety, tension, thrills or atmosphere because - quelle surprise - the love-bombing serial killer keeps getting away with it. Sure, it might tickle with the idea of him being found out by someone, but it\'s just that - light amusement, and nothing else. In this season, he\'s fled to London and inexplicably teaching a college course on literature while falling in with a crowd of evil rich people, like there\'s any other kind. One of the crowd kills another member of the crowd, attempts to pin on it him, and the killer - who he talks with through a messaging app that disappears its messages instantly - discovers his true identity.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\'You\' copies wholesale from the greats, such as Daphne DuMaurier, Patricia Highsmith, Agatha Christie, but is nowhere even remotely on their level. It\'s like bad fan-fiction, and the acting is equally damnable. Penn Badgley looks like he\'s just checked out of things entirely, going through the motions, cashing the cheque, and pretty much consigning his career to this thing forever. The reliably hammy Sean Pertwee is in there as a bodyguard-fixer for one of the rich crowd, and Tati Gabrielle is more of a cameo than a permanent fixture. \'Euphoria\' alum Lukas Gage is in there as an American ex-pat and probable Fyre Festival attendee, Charlotte Richie plays a gallery manager who is - again, quelle surprise - icy and bitchy to anyone who looks at her.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The common refrain from people who have stuck with \'You\' since the beginning is that you have to watch it like it\'s a comedy. It\'s camp. It\'s ridiculous. You can see through it all. The dialogue is meant to be funny and clunky and cliched. Watching something ironically is fine, and many people do it. But after a while, you\'ve got to wonder if leaning so hard into this premise - and the writers and actors cottoning on to this - effectively means the joke has run its course. When everyone\'s in on it, how does irony sustain it? You\'re just writing crap dialogue, passing it off as comedy, and expecting everyone to laugh.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>There really is nothing redeeming about \'You\', and given how there\'s so much better TV out there, running it on for another season - or in this case, splitting one season into two - just seems like a waste of everyone\'s time, including yours.</p>', '14-\'You\'%20Season%204.png', '2023-02-12', '18:00:00', 2),

(17, 'Sid Lowe', 'Barcelona crumble ‘with no soul’ to anger Xavi and ‘give Real Madrid life’', 'Real’s failure to beat 10-man Atlético gave the leaders the chance to go 10 points clear – but Almería spoiled the party', '<p>“This is not goodbye to the league,” Carlo Ancelotti said but no one was really listening and even he didn’t sound sure, not yet. Saturday evening at the Santiago Bernabéu and it was done. Real Madrid had just drawn 1-1 with Atlético, leaving Barcelona to slip out of sight at the top, the only winners those watching in a city 600km away. If this was Diego Simeone’s final derby in the capital – the underwhelming final chapter in a rivalry he revived and suffered like no one else, a once epic series slowing to a close – he could at least depart having denied Real the title, his 10 men taking their hopes away. Or so it goes.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Instead, it turned out Ancelotti was right; turned out Thibaut Courtois was too. Twenty-four hours is a long time in football: down Real Madrid’s way, 24 seconds is. And by the following evening Barcelona had lost and it was back on again.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Min-Jae Kim hits the crossbar with a header but Napoli were not to be denied against Empoli. “The point doesn’t taste like much although it’s better than nothing,” Courtois had said after the derby, but it didn’t feel like it then. Although Álvaro Rodríguez, an 18-year-old playing only his second game but destined to play many more, had equalised José Giménez’s opener, echoes of Raúl were not enough. Madrid were seven points behind. Barcelona had a game and the title in hand. Speaking to Ancelotti after the game, Real’s former midfielder Guti began his question noting that it was “practically over”, while the press conference preamble mentioned maths, and everyone knows what that means: forget it. Mathematically, it’s not over, but … But, let’s face it, it’s finished, and in February.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>It was all over bar the shouting, although there was plenty of that. Atlético had been down to 10 for half the match after Ángel Correa had given Antonio Rüdiger a dig in the ribs with his elbow, making the last five men sent off in the derby Atlético players. “It wasn’t enough to tumble a guy who’s 1.94[m],” Simeone insisted afterwards; at the time he had stood on the touchline measuring the difference, one arm up, one down. “Nothing new at the Bernabéu,” Atlético tweeted. A photo of “our ‘aggressor’s’ leg” went up showing two not especially remarkable scratches. “Enough already,” Antoine Griezmann declared. “Maybe next time we’ll start with 10,” Jan Oblak said. Atlético’s chief executive, Miguel Ángel Gil Marín, put out a statement calling it unacceptable, declaring “we always suffer this against this team”, insisting “we can’t normalise what is abnormal”. And yet ultimately the derby seemed to have done more damage to Real. Unable to raise themselves again – “This is not the champions,” ran the cover of AS – there was little really created until the final minutes of a game of few chances, the league lost. “It was hard before, and it’s even harder now,” Ancelotti admitted to Guti. Asked if he was bidding farewell to the league, Real’s manager sat listening, left eyebrow gently lifting, gave a shrug Alan Partridge would have been pleased with, and said: “No, this was not goodbye.” Nor though, he admitted, was it good and there hadn’t been much conviction. “It’s more complicated now,” he conceded. “We have to fight to the end and see what happens.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>What happens? Shit happens, he knows. “I’ve lost a European Cup final 3-0 down at half-time,” Ancelotti says. He has also won a European Cup final 1-0 down in the 93rd minute. He won last year’s Champions League, from 2-0 down and 4-3 down and 5-3 down along the way, the most absurd thing ever. And last week’s Champions League meeting at Anfield, 2-0 down in 14 minutes. This is the club too that turned the title race around in 18 ridiculous seconds, that made a myth of the remontada even when it wasn’t real. But still no one expected this, which was probably their first mistake.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“Atlético distance Madrid from the league,” said AS; a distance so big that they could only see Barcelona “with a telescope”. Marca’s cover declared “Atlético had knocked Real out of the league”. The Catalan papers meanwhile were getting giddy: this was “a golden opportunity”, El Mundo Deportivo cheered. “This league cannot escape!” shouted Sport.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Or perhaps it can. Barcelona had won seven in a row. They had won 12 of their last 13. They had only been defeated once – way back in October, against Madrid. They had only dropped points twice since the opening day. They had let in one goal in seven games and seven all season. All they had to do was win against Almería, who had let in six the week before, whose coach was under pressure, and who had started the day in the relegation zone, to go 10 points clear.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>A superb strike from El Bilal Touré was the only goal of the game. “This was a historic day,” Almería’s coach, Rubi, said. “Unexpected,” he called it, speaking for everyone. “We didn’t expect to lose,” Frenkie de Jong admitted, possibly saying more than he meant to. It wasn’t just that they lost, either: it was that they deserved to, that they were just, well, nothing. Pedri didn’t play, neither did Ousmane Dembélé, Jules Koundé nor Alejandro Balde Ronald Araújo didn’t play, until he was sent on as an emergency striker for the last 20 minutes. Eric García did. Barcelona didn’t manage a shot on target until Ángel Alarcón, an 18-year-old who had only played four minutes in La Liga before, came on. By which point, they were throwing balls into the box. Forty crosses Almería faced, Rodrigo Ely and Srdjan Babic endlessly heading them out of harm’s way.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Maybe it shouldn’t have been such a huge surprise. Barcelona have won 1-0 seven times this season: in four of those Pedri has scored the only goal and he was missing, the one man who could also offer something a little more subtle, a little more incisive. Robert Lewandowski has been off form since the World Cup and barely saw the ball, which is becoming a recurring theme. Worse, he departed Almería injured. Looking at the bench, there was not much there that offered a way back in: from players or coach. Looking on the pitch, there wasn’t much either, only Ferran Torres occasionally looking as if he might find a way. They didn’t compete or rebel.</p>', '19-Barcelona%20crumble.jpg', '2023-02-27', '16:20:00', 3),

So, who will hold their nerves as the season ends?', '<p>Let\'s start by looking at the Premier League title race, where Manchester City are once again on the hunt for what would be their third successive league win. Over the last five years, their nearest competitor has been Liverpool. But this year, Arsenal have been their main competition.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Mikel Arteta played for Arsenal for five years before becoming Guardiola\'s assistant coach at Manchester City. In 2019, he left Manchester City to become the first-team coach at his old club and will meet his mentor in the race to win Arsenal\'s first Premier League since 2004. The race for the title has been intense. As a result of Queen Elizabeth\'s death in September 2022 and the postponement of games for this season, Arsenal and City did not play each other in the league until February, which is unusually late in the season. Pep\'s side came out on top on that occasion, putting themselves ahead of Arsenal, only to lose to Nottingham Forest, allowing Arteta\'s side to leapfrog them once again.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>After playing one fewer game, Arsenal have a two-point lead over City. With 15 games to go, there\'ll be plenty of twists and turns ahead.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Over in Spain, there is a wider gap at the top. Barcelona are five points clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. What\'s most impressive about their season so far is their defensive record. With just seven goals conceded, that\'s at least ten fewer than the next-best team. Due to their exit from the Champions League earlier in the season, Barcelona will have to play Europa League football on Thursday nights, which could affect their schedule and form.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\"I think that the main favourite to win a La Liga trophy is Barcelona, not only obviously because they are leading the league but because of other different factors,\" explained Manuel Terradillos, Euronews journalist.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\"They have a bigger squad, and they have a squad with quality players more than the other teams, which means that they are less affected by injuries. They have Robert Lewandowski, a player who can easily average one goal per game, which means that, as some coaches say, you start every match leading 1-0.\"</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Over in Germany, the title race is closer than it has been for years. Bayern Munich dominates the league and have won ten consecutive titles, but the competition for their crown is sterner than ever.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, and Union Berlin are tied on points. The Union Berlin story, in particular, is very impressive. The club was only promoted from the second division of German football in 2019, and yet only four years later, they are going toe-to-toe with one of the giants of European football. At the end of February, they will face Bayern at the top of the table when they travel to Munich. Things are as expected in France. PSG have a five-point lead over Marseille at the top of Ligue 1. However, the challengers face PSG on Sunday in a game that is a must-win for them and stop PSG from winning their fourth title in five years.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>PSG would set a new record if they stayed ahead and brought the league title back to Paris again. And with players like Neymar, Mbappe, and Messi, it will be a massive challenge for Marseille to try and deny PSG another title win.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>And finally, in Italy, Napoli could see itself in the history books. They are 15 points clear of Inter Milan in this season\'s Scudetto. It\'s been 33 years since Napoli won the Serie A title. Not since Diego Maradona has Napoli won the coveted trophy, but manager Spaletti has them on the cusp of the feat.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\"This is the best Spaletti team that I\'ve ever seen. Every single player is suited to his style of football. He\'s come at the precise right time. He\'s playing the right kind of football, and he\'s got the players to express that football onto the pitch, and they\'re winning\".</p>\r\n<p>Nima Roodsari </p>\r\n<p>The Italian Football Podcast</p>\r\n<p>So, there is plenty of exciting football to watch in Europe as another season comes to an end.

(20, 'Lee Campbell', 'What will happen to Qatar\'s World Cup Stadiums?', 'It\'s hard to believe it has been two months since the World Cup final took place in Qatar.', '<p>The iconic player posters that lit up the city\'s skyscrapers have all gone. The ticketing booths, Hayya Service Centres and other tournament help points have been replaced, and the pre-tournament look has returned to the country.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>And, for now, the eight World Cup tournament stadiums are empty.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The stadiums are works of architectural brilliance, each with a unique design. They feature state-of-the-art facilities to enhance the fan experience, which left long-lasting memories of the games that took place within them. Because Qatar is a small country, there is less need for these arenas after World Cup. The stadiums have become iconic globally, but what will become of them? The goal of the Supreme Committee in 2010 was to have a sustainable legacy after the World Cup. Therefore, all eight stadiums will be utilised in some capacity. The Khalifa International Stadium, where Japan famously made the round of 16 by defeating Spain, was built before the World Cup bid was won. It will continue to be the home of Qatar\'s national team and host other large sporting events thanks to its ability to hold athletic tournaments.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Stadium 974 is certainly unique, and it hosted some memorable games to suit its striking design. Argentina progressed from the group stage by beating Poland 2-0, and Brazil ran riot against the Korea Republic in the round of 16, winning 4-1 thanks to impressive goals from Vinicius Jr and Richarlison.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The stadium took its name from the 974 shipping containers it took to construct it. The ground was praised for being the world\'s first \'transportable stadium\' because it can be dismantled and reassembled anywhere in the world.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>At the end of the World Cup, Stadium 974 was to be donated to another country. Since then, Qatar has announced other major sporting events over the upcoming 12 months that may require a stadium like 974.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\"I personally think that it\'s probably going to stay around for a little bit longer than expected,\" revealed Mitch Freely, Middle-East football expert.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\"I think now that Qatar obviously won the Asian Cup for 2024, I think the stadium is going to form a big part of that, and probably the vast majority of the World Cup stadiums are going to be used again for that tournament.\" Ahmad Bin Ali and Al Janoub stadiums will be reduced by half in capacity. Qatar will donate around 40,000 removed seats to sub-Saharan African nations to help improve those countries\' footballing infrastructure. The Qatar Stars League will use both stadiums.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>There will be a reduction in capacity for some stadiums but not a reduction in quality.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\"These stadiums are the gold standard, in my opinion. The gold standard of stadium facilities.\" - Mario Zraunig, Stadium Operations Manager at Ahmad Bin Ali.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\"And that\'s going to be the benchmark for many World Cups to come. And that\'s part of the legacy. So Qatar has always broadcasted to the world that there is a legacy for every stadium. And that goes to show the Asian Cup is going to be a following event to make sure that the facilities are utilised, to make sure that the facilities host all the events, not just the World Cup.\" Mario concluded. Meanwhile, Education City Stadium will be remembered mainly for Morocco knocking Spain out in the round of 16 in a penalty shoot-out. The stadium was named after its location and will remain part of Qatar\'s education hub. The area is home to various university campuses and facilities. The stadium sits alongside three world-class sporting pavilions for swimming, indoor sports and track and field. The area is an attractive prospect for international students looking to study in the Middle East.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Lusail and Al Bayt stadiums were the hosts to some of the tournament\'s most iconic games, with Lusail going down in history as the place where Argentina legend Lionel Messi finally lifted the World Cup. Currently, the plan is for these stadiums to be repurposed entirely. Both stadiums will become community hubs, including hotels, shopping malls and cafes. A sports medicine hospital will be built on part of the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor. It will also maintain its traditional Qatari tent design, which is synonymous with Qatari culture.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>So, Qatar\'s World Cup commitment is clear; all eight World Cup stadiums will be put to good use. From sports hospitals to their own Qatar Sports League, the country will get the best out of these state-of-the-art facilities to ensure the legacy of the 2022 World Cup is cemented for years, if not decades, to come.</p>', '24-Qatar%20World%20Cup%20stadiums.png', '2023-02-16', '14:20:00', 3),
(21, 'Nicole Narea', 'All the Republicans running for president in 2024', 'Right-wing activist Vivek Ramaswamy is the latest to challenge Trump for the GOP nomination.', '<p>Right-wing activist Vivek Ramaswamy has jumped into the 2024 race for president, adding to a growing field that is challenging former President Donald Trump for the GOP nomination.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>In an announcement video released Tuesday night, the author of the New York Times bestseller Woke, Inc. staked his candidacy on combating the “woke left” and what he referred to as “new secular religions like Covidism, climatism, and gender ideology.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“This is psychological slavery, and that has created a new culture of fear in our country that has completely replaced our culture of free speech in America,” he said in the video. While he might be speaking the language of the right-wing grassroots, he doesn’t have the political experience or the preexisting constituency of some of his GOP rivals, which include Trump and former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. Still, a growing GOP field might be welcome news to party elites who are looking for an alternative to Trump. The former president is increasingly seen as a liability after losing his reelection bid in 2020, after his chosen candidates broadly underperformed in the 2022 midterms, and because he remains under multiple civil and criminal investigations.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>It’s likely to be a tough primary. Trump, who announced his candidacy in November, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has yet to announce his candidacy, both consistently rank as the top two choices among Republican primary voters in a series of recent polls. DeSantis is virtually tied with Trump in at least one February poll, while Trump holds as much as a 20 percentage point lead in others. But it’s early in the 2024 cycle, and those numbers could change as candidates consolidate donors, attract endorsements, and actively campaign.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>An expanding GOP field may in some ways strengthen Trump’s candidacy. The more candidates announce, the greater the competition in the alternative to Trump lane.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“Everybody sort of agrees we’re going to lose if we [run Trump] again,” said Patrick Hynes, a GOP strategist based in New Hampshire. “But with multiple candidates talking about getting into the race, it just fortifies Trump’s position. And so it’d be really nice if we could just have a united front.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Here are the other major contenders — besides Trump — so far.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Already announced: Right-wing activist Vivek Ramaswamy</p>\r\n<p>The son of Indian immigrants and a former biotech founder, Ramaswamy made his name railing against socially responsible investing on cable news shows. Over the past few years, he’s been dubbed “the CEO of Anti-Woke, Inc.” by the New Yorker and has come out with a second book, Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit and the Path Back to Excellence. Recently, he’s been on a listening tour that included stops in New Hampshire, the second state to cast votes in the presidential primaries.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>All that led to his announcement for president. His campaign appears as if it will center culture wars: He told Fox News’s Tucker Carlson after jumping into the race that his top priorities include ending affirmative action, “complete decoupling” from China, reenvisioning US immigration policy based on “merit,” and using the American military to combat drug cartels in Central America. While well-known in conservative circles, Ramaswamy would need to find a way to pivot his message to make it more appealing to independents and moderates in a general election. First, though, he will face rivals with far greater platforms, name recognition, donor networks, and war chests — many of whom have spent years developing their own brand of his politics.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The February Monmouth poll found that “other” candidates only attracted 4 percent of those polled, suggesting a difficult battle ahead for Ramaswamy or any other candidate not already a household name.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Already announced: Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley</p>\r\n<p>Though she had previously dismissed the prospect of running against Trump if he sought reelection, Trump’s US ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley announced in mid-February that she’s running.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Haley framed herself as a moderate candidate relative to Trump who can win in a general election. “Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections. That has to change,” Haley said in her announcement video. “It’s time for a new generation of leadership.” The daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley is centering her pitch for the presidency on foreign policy. In particular, she’s suggested that she would take a hardline stance against America’s foes abroad. She had one of the highest approval ratings of anyone in the Trump administration and was well-respected by her peers on the UN Security Council even when espousing controversial policy decisions, such as Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate accords, and the UN Human Rights Council. In an environment where most Americans cite government and inflation as the top issues facing the US, it’s not clear whether that foreign policy experience will resonate with voters. But Haley has conservative credentials, too.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>She won the South Carolina governorship in 2011 with the support of the conservative Tea Party wing of the Republican Party and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. She went on to tighten voter ID laws, oppose Syrian refugee resettlement in the state, and earn bipartisan praise for signing a bill to take down the Confederate flag from the state capitol after a gunman killed nine Black churchgoers in Charleston in 2015. In her announcement video, she hit typical conservative priorities, railing against the “socialist left” while calling for securing the border and fiscal responsibility.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>If Haley prevails, she would be the first woman and first Asian American to win the GOP nomination for president, adding to the list of firsts she has already achieved: South Carolina’s first woman governor and the first Indian American to serve in a statewide office there.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Yet to announce: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis</p>\r\n<p>Buzz has been building over DeSantis’s candidacy for months, as many party leaders see him as the ideal alternative to Trump.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>DeSantis has been carefully cultivating a national profile for years by making Florida a locus of conservative policymaking that has inspired copycat legislation across the US. He’s promoted popular conservative stances on nearly every culture war issue, including battling “woke” corporations like Disney, minimizing Covid-19, limiting abortion access, and eliminating parts of school curriculums deemed too liberal.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Beyond just legislating to the right, DeSantis has ensured that Florida will likely stay red for the foreseeable future. In the 2022 redistricting cycle, he pushed for a new, gerrymandered congressional map that ultimately heavily benefited Republicans; the party flipped three House seats in the midterms. He expanded the base, winning counties like Miami-Dade that Republicans haven’t carried in decades, while appearing to make more headway with Latino voters. He raised more than $200 million last cycle, breaking the record for gubernatorial races, and ultimately secured reelection by 20 points.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>His midterms performance was a bright spot for the GOP, especially because Republican candidates underperformed practically everywhere else in the midterms, and cemented DeSantis’s reputation as a national star in the party. If Republicans choose DeSantis, it wouldn’t really mark a departure from Trumpism. The Florida governor was once a protégé of the former president and employs the same rhetorical style to articulate culture war grievances. Before the midterms, he made his name through attention-grabbing stunts and ultra-right-wing policies on issues ranging from race and gender to immigration that have become templates for other states. Certainly, DeSantis would have to contort himself to look like a moderate in a general election against President Joe Biden or another Democrat.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Yet to announce: US Sen. Tim Scott</p>\r\n<p>The junior US senator from South Carolina and the only Black Republican in the chamber is weighing his candidacy during a listening tour. Education and police reform will likely be centerpieces of his pitch should he choose to do so. Like many other GOP presidential hopefuls, Scott is a proponent of “school choice” — allowing parents to choose alternatives to traditional public schools, such as charter schools or private schools, and allowing public funds to follow students to those schools. The co-founder of the Congressional School Choice Caucus, Scott led the charge against a controversial Biden administration rule last year that imposed new requirements on charter school funding, including providing proof of need and community support and that the school is not managed by a for-profit company.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>While charter schools have delivered massive achievement gains for some low-income minority students, Democrats have soured on them in recent years on the basis that they reduce funding for neighborhood public schools and evidence that they can increase racial and socioeconomic segregation. Biden himself has said he’s “not a charter-school fan.”\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“This administration wants to shut down charter schools and starve them of the resources necessary to have parents given the choice and the kids given that very important chance,” Scott said in a February interview on the Students Over Systems podcast.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Scott may also lean on his experience as the GOP’s point person on police reform, calling for a solution to “ensure only the best wear the badge through more funding and training for law enforcement” in his response to Biden’s State of the Union address in February.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>He unsuccessfully led Senate negotiations on the subject in 2021 alongside his Democratic counterpart, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. In the wake of the recent release of footage of Memphis police beating Tyre Nichols, a Black man who later died from his injuries, Scott has expressed interest in revisiting those negotiations.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Scott doesn’t have national name recognition to rival that of Trump or DeSantis. And Haley, who originally appointed him as US senator while serving as South Carolina governor, may siphon away some of his support in the state. But he’s a strong fundraiser and has been recognized as a leader in the party, tapped to deliver the official GOP response to Biden’s State of the Union address in 2021.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Yet to announce: Former Vice President Mike Pence</p>\r\n<p>Pence has made clear that he’s severed ties with Trump, telling CNBC that the GOP is “going to have better choices” than the former president. And he said he thought Trump was “wrong” in insisting that he won the 2020 election and that he was “reckless” with his words and actions on the day of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol in an interview with NPR last November.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>That might not earn him any favor among Trump loyalists. But as a prominent evangelical, Pence could make a play for the Christian right by appealing to their conservative views on abortion, religious liberty, and education. He already seems to be doing so, promoting his memoir, So Help Me God, at megachurches around the country.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Though the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade dampened GOP gains in the midterms, Pence hasn’t tempered his anti-abortion rhetoric. He’s called for a national abortion ban, throwing his weight behind a proposal by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, and a ban on abortion pills. Beyond abortion, Pence’s policy group, Advancing American Freedom, has laid out a platform that includes an expansion of 529 college savings plans for K-12 programs, promoting the rights of health care providers to decline to perform certain services on the basis of moral or religious objections, rolling back climate change-related regulations, and more.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>That agenda also highlights Pence’s biggest challenge: differentiating himself from Trump. It touts many of the policies advanced by the Trump-Pence administration, including the still-incomplete construction of the border wall and the United States Mexico Canada Agreement. Given that many of Pence’s achievements are inextricable from Trump’s, it’s not clear whether the former vice president will be able to step out from his onetime running mate’s shadow.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Yet to announce: Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan</p>\r\n<p>Hogan is a self-proclaimed centrist and was bipartisanly popular during his tenure as Maryland governor, forced to work with a Democrat-controlled legislature for all eight years he was in office. He couldn’t seek reelection in 2022 because he was term-limited, and after his chosen successor lost the GOP primary to a Trump endorsee, Democrat Wes Moore ultimately won the governorship.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Hogan attracted Trump’s ire as one of only a few Republicans who have for years openly criticized the former president, notably for his pandemic response and attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump has shot back with his own attacks, calling Hogan a “shutdown RINO” (Republican in name only) for implementing pandemic-related lockdowns in 2020.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Hogan has been similarly critical of DeSantis, saying in an interview with CNN in January that though he may be popular with the GOP base, he has done a “terrible job” of speaking to swing voters. That’s the same criticism he’s levied against his own state party, which has been left directionless in his absence.\r\n In his time as governor, Hogan employed a science-led response to the pandemic that endeared him to Democrats. He made it easier to staff up on out-of-state health care workers, shut down all nonessential small businesses, closed schools, delayed the 2020 primary, established a vaccine distribution initiative, issued a state-based stimulus check for low-income residents, and made a pandemic economic recovery plan that left the state with a multibillion-dollar surplus. He also opened all in-person polling locations in 2020 and went against teachers unions in calling for a return to the classroom in early 2021.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Whether there’s room for Hogan’s moderation in a GOP primary, however, remains a question. He told Meet the Press on February 19 that he, too, is on a listening tour, and that “we’re going to make a decision in a relatively short period of time.”</p>', '25-All%20the%20Republicans.png', '2023-02-23', '16:25:00', 1),

A period of inactivity over the last week has given space for Boris Johnson and other Brexiteers to start to agitate against the plan.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Any rebellion in Westminster could have been neutered by bringing the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) on side.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>But it\'s here where the politics looks most precarious for the prime minister.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>There are questions about whether the DUP has been kept in the loop - even informally - about talks with the EU.

(23, 'Lisa O\'Carroll and Aubrey Allegretti', 'Rishi Sunak agrees deal with EU over Brexit Northern Ireland protocol', 'Prime minister unveils agreement with European Commission president after four months of negotiations', '<p>Rishi Sunak has hailed a “new chapter” in the UK’s relationship with the EU as he secured a deal to end the long-running dispute over the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The prime minister and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, described it as a “decisive breakthrough” at a joint news conference in Windsor after four months of intense negotiations.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>During a carefully choreographed announcement that appeared to leave hardline Brexiters more isolated, Sunak claimed the changes would allow the UK “take back control”.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>“Today’s agreement is written in the language of laws and treaties. But really it’s about much more than that,” he said. “It’s about stability in Northern Ireland. It’s about real people and real businesses. It’s about showing that our union that has lasted for centuries can and will endure.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The deal, labelled the “Windsor framework”, goes further than previously expected by giving the UK government an “emergency brake” on new EU laws applied in Northern Ireland if politicians in the province object to them. Von der Leyen stressed this was an emergency mechanism and the European court of justice would have the final say on single market issues. The agreement will create a new green lane for traders, scrapping all trade restrictions between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and new freedoms for medicines, chilled meats and pets to move over the Irish Sea. It also rewrites parts of the existing protocol to allow Westminster to set VAT rates in Northern Ireland. The deal was welcomed by the main UK opposition parties – with the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, saying that while it was not perfect he understood there was an obligation to make it work – as well as many Conservative MPs who have been desperate for the prime minister to resolve the dispute before the next general election.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>However, Sunak still faces discord from the hardline Brexiter wing of his party amid concerns over the continued role of EU law in Northern Ireland. Government insiders believe he can limit any rebellion to about 20 Tory MPs when the Commons is eventually given a vote, which is not expected to be this week.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The Democratic Unionist party leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said it was “clear that significant progress had been secured across a number of areas” which “vindicated the Democratic Unionist party’s year-long boycott of power sharing in protest against the protocol”.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>However, there were concerns among some hardliners, with the DUP MP Ian Paisley saying the Windsor framework “does not cut the mustard” and provided no basis for the party to go back into power sharing in Stormont.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Stephen Farry, of Northern Ireland’s Alliance party, said it broadly welcomed the agreement but had “massive concerns over the Stormont brake”. He told the prime minister: “There are real dangers that this process could add more instability into the assembly.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Boris Johnson, who negotiated the original protocol in 2020 despite all the problems it created on the ground in Northern Ireland, was understood to be studying and reflecting on the proposals. However, he was said to have urged the DUP to be cautious about the plan.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The former prime minister’s controversial bill to override post-Brexit rules on Northern Ireland, which is on ice in the House of Lords, was dumped by Sunak after he negotiated the new deal. Johnson had warned his successor that scrapping the legislation would be a “great mistake”, but Sunak said there was no longer legal justification for the bill.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The Guardian reported last month that the attorney general, Victoria Prentis, had said the bill was likely to be legally unsound because of the progress of the negotiations – and the “doctrine of necessity” no longer applied in order to give cover to override international law. In advance of the announcement in Windsor, which took place underneath a portrait of the late Queen, Von der Leyen’s arrival was overshadowed by a row over the role of King Charles in the final deal – who had tea with the EU leader in Windsor Castle after it was sealed.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Both Buckingham Palace and No 10 sought to place the responsibility for the meeting on each other after it angered Tory Brexiters and some senior figures in the DUP, who claimed it risked dragging the king into a divisive political issue.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The DUP’s former first minister Arlene Foster said it was “crass and will go down very badly in Northern Ireland” and the Labour MP Chris Bryant said it was a “terrible mistake from the government – we should never bring the monarchy into political disputes”.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Both leaders emphasised a step-change in the relationship between the UK and the EU, with Von der Leyen addressing the prime minister as “Dear Rishi” and saying she had taken “a great sense of satisfaction” in building a new constructive partnership.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Von der Leyen hinted the deal would open the door to a closer, more constructive relationship with the EU including, as its first steps, closer participation in Brussels programmes, as well as working together on Ukraine and the climate crisis. The Windsor framework will create a new green lane for traders, scrapping all trade restrictions between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and new freedoms for medicines, chilled meats and pets to move over the Irish Sea.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>It involves the rewriting of parts of the protocol, something the prime minister pointed out the EU said it would never do during negotiations with his predecessors and David Frost, the former Brexit negotiator.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Key is the elimination of the border in the Irish Sea for consumer goods sold in supermarkets, consumed in canteens or bought online with checks and customs. In what was seen as the most radical change to the protocol, a new mechanism, dubbed the Stormont brake, will give the UK a veto over any new EU laws applying to trade in Northern Ireland.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>It is based on a mechanism in the Good Friday agreement known as the petition of concern, which allows a group of at least 30 members of the legislative assembly to block new laws unless they have cross-community consent.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The deal also gives the UK the power to set its own VAT, alcohol tax and state aid rules and clears the way for a permanent solution to the issue of medicine supply in Northern Ireland, allowing drugs authorised by British regulatory authorities to be supplied to the NHS in Northern Ireland.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>If the deal is ratified in London and Brussels, the Northern Ireland protocol will fall away. Von der Leyen said the EU would also start the process of ratifying the UK’s associate membership of the Horizon Europe £85bn flagship science research programme which the UK has been frozen out of in a tit-for-tat retaliation by the EU.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>At the same time the EU will drop the seven EU infringement proceedings launched after the UK’s decision to unilaterally dis-apply the protocol in 2021 and table the Northern Ireland protocol bill.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The Irish government has welcomed the protocol deal as a “new chapter” in relations between the EU and UK and an opportunity to end Northern Ireland’s political vacuum.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said the agreement, if implemented, would bring stability and certainty to a situation that has been in flux. It should strengthen relations between Dublin and London and pave the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland, he told a news conference.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Ireland’s foreign minister, Micheál Martin, said the deal opened a “new chapter” for the EU and UK, who he said were natural partners in addressing global challenges, from Ukraine to the climate crisis. “It is in Ireland’s interests that the EU and the UK have a positive, forward-looking relationship.”</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>The deal also seemingly won the approval of Joe Biden, who called the agreement an “essential step to ensuring that the hard-earned peace and progress of the Belfast/Good Friday agreement is preserved and strengthened”.</p>', '26-Rishi%20Sunak%20agrees%20deal.png', '2023-02-27', '20:56:00', 1);
